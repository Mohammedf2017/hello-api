                "IntelliJ is just confused. Your Maven setup is correct! " +

/*
🎯 TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Save this file (ignore red annotations!)
2. Stop your app: Ctrl+C in terminal
3. Restart: mvn spring-boot:run
4. Test: http://localhost:8080/proof

🏆 EXPECTED RESULT:
You'll see the success message, proving your dependencies work!

💡 THE TRUTH:
- Your Maven dependencies (3.5.4) are correctly downloaded ✅
- Your Spring Boot app runs perfectly ✅
- IntelliJ just can't see them (cosmetic issue only) ❌
- Adding wrong version (2.4.2) would BREAK everything ❌

🚀 AFTER THIS WORKS:
We'll proceed with your full HelloController and complete Day 29!
